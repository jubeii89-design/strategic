/**
 * The canonical completed game from the task brief (PokerStraights mode,
 * round total 286), transcribed from the owner's screenshot.
 *
 * Scorecard: HAND ID row / SCORE row:
 *   1:3A/35 2:4B/43 3:4F/22 4:4G/7 5:3E/9 6:4H/-4 7:4H/-4 8:4C/28 9:3F/-3  → 133
 *   10:3A/35 11:4H/-4 12:4F/22 13:4H/-4 14:3C/18 15:4C/28 16:5G/19 17:5H/16 18:4E/23 → 153
 *
 * KEY FINDING — why holes 7-9 don't match the final board: the original game
 * froze those three hands' scores before their last card arrived. In this
 * game the last three cards placed were 3♥,4♥,5♥ into row 0 (completing
 * hole 1), and columns 7/8/9 kept the scores of the 4/4/3 cards below row 0.
 * Board-state scoring of the final layout therefore yields 5J/5G/4H for
 * holes 7-9 (front 122, round 275), while evaluating the frozen card subsets
 * reproduces the scorecard exactly.
 *
 * RESOLUTION: with Engine.cs, CardSlot.cs and the complete CardHand.cs all
 * inspected, the shortened 4/4/3-card evaluations are provably impossible
 * in the decompiled assembly — CheckIfHandIsComplete requires every slot
 * filled, SetCard/GetCard are synchronous with placement, CardHand has no
 * provisional scoring, and CheckForCompletedHands always passes
 * hand.Count cards to the scorer. This scorecard therefore came from an
 * EARLIER BUILD of the game that could lock a hand's score before its last
 * card arrived (the two screenshots even use different scoreboard layouts:
 * HOLE/PAR/SCORE vs HAND/PAR/SCORE/HAND ID). Per-hand scoring parity is
 * unaffected: every ID→points pair on both scorecards matches the engine.
 * Note for the future game-loop: CheckIfHandIsComplete sets
 * handCompletedAnimationCompleted = true as a side effect of the CHECK,
 * so in the current build a hand is scored exactly once, when it fills.
